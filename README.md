These are high-quality projects, but you're an algorithms person, so we're good. After all, these are applications a lot of people use hence qualifying the 'real life' tag.
Programming languages/Compilers. Lots of interesting work goes into language and compiler design including a ridiculous amount of effort to achieve efficiency. Examples - scala, io, clojure,  clojurescript.
Text editors. The search stuff, in-memory trees for any open source files, file sync, autocompletion, highlighting, etc. Example - atom/atom.
Statistical libraries. This is theoretical mathematics, but one needs to implement the right computation stuff, especially in newer libraries. Examples - jstat, statsmodels.
Routing stuff - mcrouter
AI/ML libraries - pushkar/ABAGAIL
Databases are programs too. Queries don't optimise themselves. Examples - YapDatabase, mackyle/sqlite
Algorithms. Implementations of well-known algorithms and data structures for others to use  - kanwei/algorithms (Ruby)
Operating Systems - redox-os
Simulation - newton-dynamics
Miscellaneous - Z3Prover/z3
